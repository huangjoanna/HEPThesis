\section{Detector-level results}
\label{sec:m4lrecoresults}
In this section the detector-level selected events are presented and compared to the SM predictions for the single $Z$, Higgs, \onshellZZ and \offshellZZ mass regions, and for the inclusive \mFourL{} distribution. The reducible background described in Section~\ref{sec:background} is also included. 

The number of selected events in the four \mFourL{} regions over the full fiducial phase space is presented in Table~\ref{tab:RecoYieldTablePerProcess}, along with the predicted number of events, and the predicted background contribution from non-prompt leptons. For the \qqFourL{} process the \SHERPA{} simulation is used. The combined uncertainties (systematic and statistical) are also quoted. The uncertainty in the total prediction takes into account correlations between processes, and therefore contributions in a given column do not trivially add up in quadrature to give the total. Uncertainties in the predictions arise from the sources discussed in Sections~\ref{sec:background} and~\ref{sec:uncertainties}.

     \caption{Predicted reconstruction-level yields per process and in total,
      compared with observed data counts, over the full fiducial phase space and in the
      following regions of
      $\mFourL$: \ZFourL{}  ($60 < \mFourL < 100$~\GeV), \HFourL{}  ($120 <
\mFourL < 130$~\GeV), off-shell $\Z\Z$  ($20 <
\mFourL < 60$~\GeV\ or $100 <
\mFourL < 120$~\GeV\ or $130 <
\mFourL < 180$~\GeV) and  on-shell \Z\Z{} ($180 <
\mFourL < 2000$~\GeV).
     The background row is events with non-prompt leptons,
     including those from $\Z{} + \Upsilon{}$ events.
      The \HFourL{} row includes only the
      on-shell Higgs boson contribution, with off-shell contributions included in
     \ggFourL{}. This table is from Reference~\cite{m4l_internalnote}. \label{tab:RecoYieldTablePerProcess} }
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:recoresults1} shows the inclusive \mFourL{} distribution at the detector level. The data are plotted in black along with the uncertainties. The SM prediction is separated into the individual dominant processes described in Section~\ref{sec:fourlepmotivation} and plotted as stacked histograms. 
Overall the data are in good agreement with the predictions, with some minor fluctuations in the high mass bins due to low statistics. The detector-level plots for the rest of the observables are not shown in the scope of this thesis, but are published in Reference~\cite{m4l2021_paper}.

    \caption{Observed reconstruction-level \mFourL{} distribution compared with the SM prediction, using
      \SHERPA{} for the \qqFourL{} simulation.
     The statistical uncertainty of the
      data is displayed as error bars and systematic uncertainties
      in the prediction are shown as a grey hashed band.  The
      ratio of the data to the prediction is shown in the lower
      panel.  The $x$-axis is on a linear scale until $\mFourL = 225$~\GeV,
where it switches to a logarithmic scale, as indicated by the double
dashes on the axis.
      There is one additional data event reconstructed with 
$\mFourL = 2.14$~\TeV, while 0.4 events are expected from simulation for
$\mFourL > 2$~\TeV. This figure is from Ref.~\cite{m4l2021_paper}. \label{fig:recoresults1}}
